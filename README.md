Overview
---
In this project, I used deep neural networks (more specifically convolutional neural networks) to classify traffic signs. I have trained and validated the neural network model so it can classify traffic sign images using the [German Traffic Sign Dataset](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset). After the model is trained, I then tried out my model on images of German traffic signs that I found on the web.
