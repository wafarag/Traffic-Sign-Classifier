# Behaviorial Cloning Project


Overview
---
This repository contains the files for the Driving Behavioral Cloning Project.

In this project, I have used deep neural networks (more precisely convolutional neural networks) to clone driving behavior. I have built, trained, validated and tested the neural network model using Tensorflow/Keras. The model outputs a steering angle to an autonomous vehicle.
